What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
-if you are asked to find the name of the person having phone number say “1234” with the help of a telephone directory. Since telephone directory is sorted by name not by numbers,we have to go through each and every number of the directory

What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
-For example, we want to find the minimum size needed for a square office that must freely accommodate all the employees of a company. We can perform a binary search for that size rather than sequentially checking all the possible sizes. We usually estimate the minimum and maximum sizes over which we do a binary search. Next, we just check some middle value and the interval can be halved again, and so on.

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
-7

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
-3

Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
-Linear search because the collection is unsorted, there is no way to use binary search since you cannot find the mid point.

Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
-Binary search because the collection is sorted, you can find the mid point of the collection.

Programming Assignment:
You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.
-
var names = ["Albatross", "Albay", "Albedo", "Albedometer", "Albee"];

function findWord(arr, word){
  var low = arr[0];
  var high = arr[arr.length -1];

  while (low <= high) {
    var mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) / 2;
    mid = Math.round(mid);

    if(arr[mid] > word) {
      high = arr[mid -1];
    }
    else if (arr[mid] < word) {
      low = arr[mid + 1];
    }
    else {
      return arr[mid];
    }
  }
  return "That name is not in the list";
}

console.log(findWord(names, "Albatross"));

You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.
-
var fishTank = ["goldfish", "betta", 
			"whitecloud", "black molly", "white-spotted goldfish"];

function whiteFish(arr, target){
  for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if (arr[i] === target){
      return "You've net the white-spotted goldfish!";
    }
  }
  return "The white-spotted goldfish isn't here!";
}

console.log(whiteFish(fishTank, "white-spotted goldfish"));
